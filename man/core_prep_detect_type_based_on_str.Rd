\title{Detect data type in a character vector based on content patterns}
\usage{
core_prep_detect_type_based_on_str(
  x,
  prior_type_info = NULL,
  num_allowed_strings = NULL,
  date_allowed_strings = NULL,
  time_allowed_strings = NULL,
  logical_allowed_strings = NULL,

  check_sequence = c("time", "date", "logical", "numeric", "categorical"),
  honour_blank_detection = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector to classify.}

\item{prior_type_info}{Optional vector of prior type assignments (same length
as \code{x}). If provided and valid, all non-\code{"character"} elements are
preserved and only \code{"character"} elements are further classified.}

\item{num_allowed_strings, date_allowed_strings, time_allowed_strings, logical_allowed_strings, categorical_allowed_strings}{Optional character vectors of sub-strings to ignore for detection of their
respective types (or in other words are allowed to coexist with value).
(except for \code{categorical_allowed_strings}, which is used for categorical
sampling.)}

\item{check_sequence}{Character vector specifying the order (subset of
\code{"time"}, \code{"date"}, \code{"logical"}, \code{"numeric"}, \code{"categorical"}) in which
type detectors are applied. The first match is assigned.}

\item{honour_blank_detection}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, blanks
detected at any stage are immediately classified as \code{"blank"} and skipped
in further checks.}
}
\value{
A character vector of detected types, same length as \code{x}.
}
\description{
Classifies each element of a character vector as \code{"numeric"}, \code{"date"},
\code{"time"}, \code{"logical"}, \code{"categorical"}, \code{"character"}, or \code{"blank"} by
applying specialized detectors in a configurable sequence. Optimized for
large vectors with many repeated values, using unique-value optimization.
