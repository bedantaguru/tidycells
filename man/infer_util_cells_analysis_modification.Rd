\title{Modify cell analysis based on relationships between data and attribute blocks}
\usage{
infer_util_cells_analysis_modification(
  ca,
  point_1,
  point_2,
  return_actions = FALSE,
  do_action = "none",
  HOT_to = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ca}{A cell analysis object to be modified}

\item{point_1}{A point object containing type (data or attr) and which
(row/column position)}

\item{point_2}{A point object containing type (data or attr) and which
(row/column position)}

\item{return_actions}{Logical; if TRUE returns possible actions instead of
modifying the object}

\item{do_action}{Character; the action to perform ("join", "connect",
"detach", "change_HOT")}

\item{HOT_to}{Character; new header orientation tag value when changing HOT}
}
\value{
If return_actions is TRUE, returns a character vector of possible
actions (also include conflict indication like
"conflict_multiple_selection"). Otherwise, returns a modified cell analysis
object.
}
\description{
An internal utility function that allows for modifications of
cell analysis objects based on the relationship between two points (data or
attribute blocks). It supports operations like joining data blocks,
connecting attributes to data blocks, detaching attributes, and changing
header orientation tags.
