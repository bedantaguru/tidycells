\title{Collate Columns Across a List of Data Frames or Cells Composition Object}
\usage{
collate_columns(x, ..., fixed_columns = NULL, similarity_threshold = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of data frames or a cells composition object (which is also a
list of data frames).}

\item{...}{Reserved for future use or passed to methods.}

\item{fixed_columns}{Character vector of column names that must be preserved
and not merged. If \code{NULL}, these are inferred as the intersection of column
names across all data frames. (These can not be like \verb{^uncollated_} or
start with "uncollated_".)}

\item{similarity_threshold}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Columns with similarity
above this threshold are considered for merging. Default is \code{0} (maximum
merging/stacking).}
}
\value{
A data frame with fixed columns and a set of collated columns, where
similar columns from the input list have been merged based on content
similarity.
}
\description{
Collates ("stacks") columns from a list of data frames or cells composition
object by merging/stacking columns with similar content, regardless of column
names. The function is "content-aware": it analyzes column values and
intelligently merges columns that are highly similar, minimizing redundant
columns and maximizing within-column similarity.
}
\details{
This function generalizes the behavior of \code{dplyr::bind_rows} (or \code{rbind}),
but rather than simply aligning columns by name or order, it matches columns
based on their data content. If \code{similarity_threshold = 1}, the function
behaves like \code{bind_rows}, keeping columns separate unless their contents are
identical. If \code{similarity_threshold = 0}, the function aggressively merges
columns with any overlap, reducing the number of columns as much as possible.
The function does not use or preserve non-fixed column namesâ€”output columns
are renamed (e.g., \code{collated_1}, \code{collated_2}, etc.) and only the values
matter for matching.
\itemize{
\item Fixed columns are always preserved and appear as-is in the result.
\item Non-fixed columns are merged based on a similarity measure computed from their values, not their names.
\item Output column names (other than fixed columns) are automatically generated.
\item Designed for use with data extracted from complex or heterogeneous tables, especially when column names are not trustworthy or consistent.
